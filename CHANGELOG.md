go test ./...

# Run load tests
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
hey -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/api/events
```

### Error Scenario Testing

1. **Network Disconnection**: Disconnect internet and verify fallback to sample data
2. **Invalid Bot Token**: Enter invalid Telegram bot token and verify error handling
3. **Large Message**: Select many events to exceed character limit and verify warnings
4. **Empty Results**: Test with date filters that return no results
5. **JavaScript Errors**: Disable JavaScript and verify graceful degradation

### Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**: Use hey tool to test with 100+ concurrent requests
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during extended use
3. **Response Times**: Verify API responses under 500ms for typical queries
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

### Security Testing

1. **XSS Prevention**: Test with malicious input in search fields
